        <div class="subheading mb-5">History - AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, Iâ€™m Belen. I am working on finishing my Bachelor of Arts in History/Administrative Studies Major at the University of Riverside. I have worked in various different settings, which have helped me improve my skills. I have over three years of customer service experience, which has taught me time management skills and how to use critical thinking best to solve a problem. I have also worked as a File Clerk for a workers compensation company. At this job, I was tasked with handling sensitive documents and organizing them in our system. I am currently working as a temporary Office Clerk at a dental office, which has taught me how to efficiently work in a team and helped me improve my project management skills. I also occasionally work as a part-time sub for The Riverside Unified School District. I have spent a few months working at schools, and I found that I enjoy helping teachers, students, and parents. My work experience is evidence that I quickly pick up new skills and I am enthusiastic about collaborating with others.<br><br>

        While I enjoy working with others, I am also comfortable with working independently. My first two jobs have prepared me to work with a group and how to best delegate responsibility. I am a strong believer that maintaining a positive attitude will create a healthy work environment, so I always try to bring a smile to work. In  addition to aforementioned skills, I am also fluent in the Spanish language. That skill has greatly helped connect with Spanish speakers, especially when I am working at a nearby school. I have found that schools have few employees who can help Spanish speaking parents. My ability to connect with others and my basic Spanish skills have made me an asset at work. Being a history major has helped me refine my research and writing skills, while my work experience has helped me develop interpersonal communication skills. I aspire to use this opportunity to develop these skills further to ensure I will be successful in achieving my career goals after college.<br><br>

        I hope to use the skills I learned all the way to be a part of the publishing industry. I consider myself a voracious reader, so naturally I am passionate about storytelling and would love to be part of an industry that preserves stories so people worldwide can access them. Along with being a reader, I deeply enjoy traveling. I am often traveling and I enjoy learning about other cultures. As a first-generation American, my culture is very important to me. I continue to travel to Mexico to learn more about my roots and to learn how I can best help my community. I have long noticed that Latino stories and the stories of other minorities are rarely published. It has long been a goal of mine to use my Spanish speaking skills to help highlight Latino stories and Latino authors. I enjoy meeting new people, and I like learning new skills that can help me improve myself. My biggest goal in life is to positively impact others.
